## **Getting Started**

### **Step 1: Add the OTP View to Your Layout**

Add the `OtpView` widget to your XML layout and customize its attributes. Here's an example (Not all attributes are required):

```xml
<com.matrix.otpview.OtpView
    android:id="@+id/otp"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_marginHorizontal="25dp"
    android:gravity="center"
    app:autoSize="true"
    app:borderColor="#779AEB"
    app:borderWidth="2dp"
    app:cornerRadius="8dp"
    app:inputType="number"
    app:fontFamily="@font/dm_sans_medium"
    app:highlightColor="#2A5CC1"
    app:hint="*"
    app:textStyle="bold"
    app:textColor="#835EFF"
    app:maxCountPerLine="8"
    app:onCompleteBorderColor="#2EDB17"
    app:squareColor="#871EA0FD"
    app:squareCount="6"
    app:squareHeight="50dp"
    app:squareWidth="50dp"
    app:margins="8dp"
    app:autoProcess="true"
    app:shape="square" />
```

### **Step 2: Handle OTP Completion in Your Activity**

In your activity, listen for OTP completion and handle errors as needed.

```kotlin
val otpView = findViewById<OtpView>(R.id.otp)
otpView.apply {
    setSquareCount(6)
    setOnCompleteListener { otp ->
        if (!checkOTP(otp)) {
            onOtpError(true)
        }
    }
}

fun checkOTP(otp: String): Boolean {
    return otp == "123456"
}
```
